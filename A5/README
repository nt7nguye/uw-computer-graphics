Compilation as usual:

cd A5
premake4 gmake
make

Run from Assets/ folder to correctly get .obj files. Copied the results to Images/ folder

screenshot.png would be the custom scene from 'sample.png'

Additional implementations:

+ Mirror reflection, set as 6 levels of reflection recursion.

+ Anti aliasing with 9 rays per pixel. Decreases the choppiness but I think it looks worse, maybe the randomized ray directions are not high enough or not enough total rays.

+ Progress bar when rendering.

Both extra options can be set from 'ExtraFeature.hpp'
