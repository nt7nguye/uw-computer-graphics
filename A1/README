Compilation:

Under cs488 directory:
cd A1
premake4 gmake
make
./A1

Manual:
+ Block height scales from 0.3f - 3.0f in 0.1f increments
+ Zoom from 0.3f - 3.0f in 0.1f increments
+ Persistence rate depends on drag rate in magnitude of (delta x / 1000)
+ Right-click to break persistence, it could be broken with key press but I'm
assuming "buttons" in the requirement means mouse button (and not left since its used to trigger rotation).
The code to break is just 'rotating_rate = 0.0f' commented out in KeyPress handler
